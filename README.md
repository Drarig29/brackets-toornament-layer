# brackets-toornament-layer

A layer to convert Toornament data to [brackets-viewer.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js) data.

You can use this to view Toornament stages with your own personalized viewer without embedding Toornament's viewer.

# How to test

First, do `npm start`. This will generate the database file `db.json`.

To quickly test the results, you can use `json-server`.

```bash
npx json-server db.json
```

Then, open the `/demo/index.html` file from the [brackets-viewer.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js) project.

And tada! You are viewing Toornament data with your own viewer! ðŸŽ‰
